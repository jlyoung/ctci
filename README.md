# Cracking the Coding Interview

I'm working through the sample questions found in the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) in code-kata fashion as a means to shore up my own skills in CS topics in general and proficiency in Python in particular.

I'll add my solutions to this repository as I work through the chapters and questions.

## Chapter 1
### Challenge 1.1
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

### Solution 1.1
Execute example

```bash
python ctci_01_01.py
```

Execute unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest -v ctci_01_01
```

### Challenge 1.2
Write code to reverse a C-Style String (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character )

### Solution 1.2
Execute example

```bash
python ctci_01_02.py
```

Execute unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest -v ctci_01_02
```

### Challenge 1.3
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. 
NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.
FOLLOW UP
Write the test cases for this method.

### Solution 1.3
Execute example

```bash
python ctci_01_03.py
```

Execute unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest -v ctci_01_03
```
