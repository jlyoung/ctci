# Cracking the Coding Interview

I'm working through the sample questions found in the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) in code-kata fashion as a means to shore up my own skills in CS topics in general and proficiency in Python in particular.

I'll add my solutions to this repository as I work through the chapters and questions.

## Chapter 1
### Challenge 1.1
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

### Solution 1.1
To execute from the command line

```bash
python ctci_01_01.py
```

To execute unit tests

```bash
python -m unittest -v ctci_01_01
```
